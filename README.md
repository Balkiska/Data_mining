# Python Data Mining Project

This repository contains various data mining techniques and algorithms. It's intended for educational purposes, providing practical examples and insights into data processing, analysis, and visualization using Python.

## Project Description

Each notebook within this repository focuses on a different aspect of data mining, ranging from data preprocessing to complex algorithm implementations. These examples are designed to help learners grasp the fundamentals of data mining in Python.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Relevant Python libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, etc.)

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required Python packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Balkiska/data_mining.git
cd data_mining
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

Navigate to the project directory and start Jupyter Notebook to access the notebooks:

```bash

jupyter notebook
```

 ### Create a virtual environment:

```bash

python -m venv venv
```
 ### Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

```bash

.\venv\Scripts\Activat
```
On macOS and Linux:

```bash

source venv/bin/activate
```

## Setting Up the Environment

To prepare your environment for the data mining project, follow these steps:

1. Create an alias for Python to ensure you're using Python 3:

```bash
alias python=python3
```
